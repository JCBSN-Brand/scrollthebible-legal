        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: December 30, 2024</p>
        
        <p>Scroll The Bible ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Information Stored Locally on Your Device:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Favorite verses you save</li>
            <li>Notes you create</li>
            <li>Reading preferences and settings</li>
            <li>Subscription status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage mechanisms and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
        
        <h2>Advertising and Analytics</h2>
        
        <p>We use Meta (Facebook) SDK to help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. When you first open the app, you will be asked whether you want to allow tracking via Apple's App Tracking Transparency prompt.</p>
        
        <p><strong>If you allow tracking</strong>, the following information may be collected and shared with Meta:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising identifier (IDFA)</li>
            <li>App events (such as app installs and opens)</li>
            <li>Purchase events (subscription type and value, used to measure ad effectiveness)</li>
            <li>Basic device information</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>If you do not allow tracking</strong>, we will not collect or share your advertising identifier, and personalized ad measurement will be disabled.</p>
        
        <p>We also use Apple's SKAdNetwork for privacy-preserving ad attribution, which does not track you personally.</p>
        
        <p>For more information about how Meta handles data, please review <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/" target="_blank">Meta's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>AI Bible Study Feature</h2>
        <p>When you use our AI-powered Bible study features, the verse text you're studying is sent to OpenAI's API to generate explanations and insights. We do not store these queries or responses on our servers. Please review <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for information about how they handle data.</p>
        
        <h2>Subscription Information</h2>
        <p>Subscriptions are processed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. Apple handles all payment processing according to their privacy practices. Subscription purchase events (type and value) may be shared with Meta for advertising measurement purposes if you have allowed tracking.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Tracking:</strong> You can control whether the app can track you for advertising purposes through the App Tracking Transparency prompt when you first open the app, or later in your device's Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit Ad Tracking:</strong> You can also enable "Limit Ad Tracking" in your iOS settings to limit personalized advertising across all apps.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Your personal data (favorites, notes, preferences) is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage mechanisms. We do not maintain external servers that store your personal information.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Locally stored data remains on your device until you delete the app or clear the app's data. Advertising data shared with Meta is subject to Meta's data retention policies.</p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is suitable for all ages and does not require any personal information to function. We do not enable tracking for users who do not provide consent.</p>
        
        <h2>International Users</h2>
        <p>If you are using our app from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our service providers (including Meta and OpenAI) are located.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
